<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Project is focused on showing my abilities with node.js and the language that rotate around him.
The body of the project is on the bicycle road between Colico and Chiavenna (my town).

The Project has:
* A HomePage that shows to the user the road, with a javascript saturation filter to fill the image and the image itself is clickable
* Various page for the small town that the road hit with comments and the possibility of leave a comment

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
